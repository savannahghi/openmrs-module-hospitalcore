/**
* Represent an amount of money in any currency.
*
* <P>This class assumes <em>decimal currency</em>, without funky divisions 
* like 1/5 and so on. <tt>Money</tt> objects are immutable. Like {@link BigDecimal}, 
* many operations return new <tt>Money</tt> objects. In addition, most operations 
* involving more than one <tt>Money</tt> object will throw a 
* <tt>MismatchedCurrencyException</tt> if the currencies don't match.
* 
* <h2>Decimal Places and Scale</h2>
* Monetary amounts can be stored in the database in various ways. Let's take the 
* example of dollars. It may appear in the database in the following ways :
* <ul>
*  <li>as <tt>123456.78</tt>, with the usual number of decimal places 
*    associated with that currency.
*  <li>as <tt>123456</tt>, without any decimal places at all.
*  <li>as <tt>123</tt>, in units of thousands of dollars.
*  <li>in some other unit, such as millions or billions of dollars.
* </ul>
* 
* <P>The number of decimal places or style of units is referred to as the 
* <em>scale</em> by {@link java.math.BigDecimal}. This class's constructors 
* take a <tt>BigDecimal</tt>, so you need to understand it use of the idea of scale.
*  
* <P>The scale can be negative. Using the above examples :
* <table border='1' cellspacing='0' cellpadding='3'>
*  <tr><th>Number</th><th>Scale</th></tr>
*  <tr><td>123456.78</th><th>2</th></tr>
*  <tr><td>123456</th><th>0</th></tr>
*  <tr><td>123 (thousands)</th><th>-3</th></tr>
* </table>
* 
* <P>Note that scale and rounding are two separate issues.
* In addition, rounding is only necessary for multiplication and division operations.
* It doesn't apply to addition and subtraction.
* 
* <h2>Operations and Scale</h2>
* <P>Operations can be performed on items having <em>different scale</em>. 
* For example, these  operations are valid (using an <em>ad hoc</em> 
* symbolic notation): 
* <PRE>
* 10.plus(1.23) => 11.23
* 10.minus(1.23) => 8.77
* 10.gt(1.23) => true
* 10.eq(10.00) => true
* </PRE> 
* This corresponds to typical user expectations. 
* An important exception to this rule is that {@link #equals(Object)} is sensitive 
* to scale (while {@link #eq(Money)} is not) . That is,  
* <PRE>
*   10.equals(10.00) => false
* </PRE>
*   
* <h2>Multiplication, Division and Extra Decimal Places</h2>
* <P>Operations involving multiplication and division are different, since the result
* can have a scale which exceeds that expected for the given currency. For example 
* <PRE>($10.00).times(0.1256) => $1.256</PRE>
* which has more than two decimals. In such cases, <em>this class will always round 
* to the expected number of decimal places for that currency.</em> 
* This is the simplest policy, and likely conforms to the expectations of most 
* end users.
* 
* <P>This class takes either an <tt>int</tt> or a {@link BigDecimal} for its 
* multiplication and division methods. It doesn't take <tt>float</tt> or 
* <tt>double</tt> for those methods, since those types don't interact well with
* <tt>BigDecimal</tt>. Instead, the <tt>BigDecimal</tt> class must be used when the 
* factor or divisor is a non-integer.
*  
* <P><em>The {@link #init(Currency, RoundingMode)} method must be called at least 
* once before using the other members of this class.</em> It establishes your 
* desired defaults. Typically, it will be called once (and only once) upon startup.
*  
* <P>Various methods in this class have unusually terse names, such as 
* {@link #lt} and {@link #gt}. The intent is that such names will improve the 
* legibility of mathematical expressions. Example : 
* <PRE> if ( amount.lt(hundred) ) {
*     cost = amount.times(price); 
*  }</PRE>
